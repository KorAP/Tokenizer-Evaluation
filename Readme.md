# Tokenization Benchmark

This repository contains benchmark scripts for comparing different tokenizers and sentence segmenters of German.  For trouble-free testing, all tools are provided in a Dockerfile.

This work will be presented at [EURALEX 2022](https://euralex2022.ids-mannheim.de/). Please cite as:

## Creating the container

To build the Docker image, run

```shell
$ docker build -f Dockerfile -t korap/tokenbench .
```
This will create and install an image of approximately 12GB.


## Running the evaluation suite

To run the benchmark, call

```shell
$ docker run --rm -i \
  -v ${PWD}/benchmarks:/tokenbench/benchmarks \
  -v ${PWD}/corpus:/tokenbench/corpus \
  korap/tokenbench benchmarks/[BENCHMARK-SCRIPT]
```

The supported benchmark scripts are:

### `benchmark.pl`

Performance measurements of the tools. See the tools section for some
remarks to take into account. Accepts two numerical parameters:

- The duplication count of the example file
- The number of iterations

### `benchmark_batches.pl`

Performance measurements of the tools. See the tools section for some
remarks to take into account. Accepts one numerical parameter:

- The number of iterations

Will check batches of `1000`, `2000`, `4000`, `8000` ... `8192000`
tokens against all tools.

### `empirist.pl`

To run the empirist evaluation suite, you first need to download
the empirist gold standard corpus and tooling, and extract it into
the corpus directory.

```shell
$ wget https://sites.google.com/site/empirist2015/home/shared-task-data/empirist_gold_cmc.zip
$ unzip empirist_gold_cmc.zip -d corpus

$ wget https://sites.google.com/site/empirist2015/home/shared-task-data/empirist_gold_web.zip
$ unzip empirist_gold_web.zip -d corpus
```

To investigate the output, start the benchmark with mounted
output folders

```
-v ${PWD}/output_cmc:/tokenbench/empirist_cmc
-v ${PWD}/output_web:/tokenbench/empirist_web
```

### `ud_tokens.pl`

To run the token evaluation suite against the 
[Universal Dependency](https://github.com/UniversalDependencies/UD_German-GSD)
corpus, first install the empirist tooling as explained above,
and download the corpus.

```shell
$ wget https://github.com/UniversalDependencies/UD_German-GSD/raw/master/de_gsd-ud-train.conllu \
  -O corpus/de_gsd-ud-train.conllu
```

### `ud_sentences.pl`

To run the sentence evaluation suite, first download the corpus
as explained above.


## Caveat

When running this benchmark using Docker you may need
to run all processes privileged to get
[meaningful results](https://pythonspeed.com/articles/docker-performance-overhead/).

```shell
docker run --privileged -v
```

## Tools

### Our tools for token and sentence boundary detection:

- [KorAP-Tokenizer](https://github.com/KorAP/KorAP-Tokenizer) is rule-based and compiles, using the lexical analysis generator framework [JFlex](https://jflex.de/), a list of regular expressions into a deterministic finite state automaton that can introduce segment boundaries at terminal nodes. The ruleset is based on [Apache Lucene](https://lucene.apache.org/)'s tokenizer and has been extensively modified. Rule sets are available for English, French and German. KorAP-Tokenizer is used productively for tokenization and (among other tools) for sentence segmentation of DeReKo.
- [Datok](https://github.com/KorAP/Datok) is rule-based and generates an extended finite deterministic state automaton based on a finite state transducer generated by XFST (Beesley & Karttunen 2003) which is reduced to a few transition rules and can be interpreted by Datok for tokenization and sentence segmentation. The rule set of KorAP-Tokenizer was transferred to XFST for this purpose. The generation is done with Foma (Hulden 2009). Rule sets are only available for German at this time. Datok is currently being evaluated experimentally.

### Tools for token and sentence boundary detection: 

- [SoMaJo](https://github.com/tsproisl/SoMaJo) (Proisl & Uhrig 2016) is rule-based and applies a list of regular expressions to segment a text. SoMaJo won first place in the competition of the aforementioned EmpiriST 2015 Shared Task for tokenizing German-language Web and CMC corpora and has been regularly improved since then. SoMaJo is available specifically for German.
- [Cutter](https://pub.cl.uzh.ch/wiki/public/cutter/start) (Graën et al. 2018) is rule-based and recursively applies language-specific and language-independent rules to a text to segment it. Compared to other rule-based tools, Cutter uses a context-free rather than a regular grammar.
- [OpenNLP](https://opennlp.apache.org/) is a framework that offers both tokenizers and sentence segmenters in different models. Both tools are based on a maximum entropy approach. In addition, OpenNLP offers SimpleTokenizer, a tool based on simple character class decisions.
- [JTok](https://github.com/DFKI-MLT/JTok) is based on cascading regular expressions that segment tokens until they can be assigned to a token class, which (cf. SoMaJo) can also be returned. Rules exist for English, German and Italian.
- [Waste](https://kaskade.dwds.de/waste/) (Jurish/Würzner 2013) is based on a hidden Markov model in which a pre-segmented stream of (pseudo)tokens are re-evaluated at the boundaries found and classified as to whether they are word-initial or sentence-initial.
- [Stanford Tokenizer](https://nlp.stanford.edu/software/tokenizer.shtml) is rule-based, and relies on JFlex (cf. KorAP tokenizer) to compile a deterministic finite state automaton based on a list of regular expressions that can introduce segment boundaries at terminal nodes.
- [SpaCy](https://spacy.io/usage/linguistic-features) is a framework in which the tokenization stage is rule-based and runs in several phases in which the tokens are split into increasingly finer segments. Rule sets are provided for numerous languages. Different models are offered for sentence segmentation: Sentencizer is rule-based, Dependency Parser performs a syntactic analysis, Statistical segments based on a simple statistical model.
- [Syntok](https://github.com/fnl/syntok) is rule-based and applies successive separation rules, primarily in the form of regular expressions, to an input string for segmentation. There is both a tokenizer and a sentence segmenter based on it. Rules exist for Spanish, English, and German.
- [BlingFire](https://github.com/microsoft/BlingFire) is rule-based and compiles a deterministic finite state automaton based on regular expressions, which segments at terminal nodes. The tested model is implemented cross-language with a focus on English.

### Tools for token boundary detection only:

- [TreeTagger](https://cis.uni-muenchen.de/~schmid/tools/TreeTagger/) (Schmid 1994) is a part-of-speech tagger that carries a separate rule-based tokenization tool that also uses a set of regular expressions to segment a text. TreeTagger does not itself introduce markers for sentence boundaries. [license terms](https://cis.uni-muenchen.de/~schmid/tools/TreeTagger/Tagger-Licence).
- [Elephant](https://gmb.let.rug.nl/elephant/about.php) (Evang et al. 2013) is a machine-trained system for segmentation based on Conditional Random Fields and Recurrent Neural Networks. We evaluate here a [wrapper implementation](https://github.com/erwanm/elephant-wrapper) (Moreau/Vogel, 2018) that considers only token segmentation and not sentence segmentation, although Elephant provides both.

### Tools for sentence boundary detection only:

- [Deep-EOS](https://github.com/dbmdz/deep-eos) (Schweter/Ahmed 2019) is based on different implementations of neural networks with long short-term memory (LSTM), bidirectional LSTM, and convolutional neural networks. It is not based on pre-tokenization and operates directly on character streams.
- [NNSplit](https://bminixhofer.github.io/nnsplit/) is a machine-trained approach based on a byte-level LSTM neural network.


## Results

In terms of speed, the native output of the tools was measured, while in terms of accuracy, further reshaping was necessary to make it comparable to the gold standard.
